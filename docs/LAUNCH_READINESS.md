# Launch readiness: production and advertising

*Updated 27 October 2026 after a fix pass. Nothing here has been published, posted or sent. This is a working checklist, not legal advice.*

**Scope.** This audits the **bedtime web app (`web/`) and the public site and claims**. The Lummings are a larger ecosystem (Living Lummings creative companion, Pixel studio, family companion, voices, device; see `ROADMAP.md`). Each of those lines needs its own readiness pass before it is advertised. The claims audit in section 3 applies to every line, because the public pages describe all of them.

## 1. Verdict

| Question | Answer today |
|---|---|
| Can the bedtime app be deployed? | **Yes.** Typecheck, lint, tests and the production build all pass. The build has no third-party hosts in it. |
| Is it ready to advertise? | **Nearly, but not yet.** The home page is now honest. Open items remain in section 3 (the `/shop/` storefront copy, the external CDNs on two app pages, hosting address, voices). |
| Is it ready to charge for? | **No.** No pilot, no brand clearance, no safety review, no priced offer. |

## 2. Production readiness (the web app)

| Check | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Typecheck (`tsc --noEmit`) | Pass | Pass |
| Lint (`eslint`) | Broken: no config file existed | Config added; passes |
| Tests | 39 of 40 passed (1 scaffolding test failing); 9 more tests were never run because of a quoting bug in the test script | 9 of 9 pass. Includes a privacy guard and a PWA guard |
| Production build | Pass, but ran a database migration step. (Commits pushed on 27 October also broke it: `voice.ts` imported a `*.server.*` file into browser code, which the framework forbids) | Pass; build is just `vite build`. The voice fallback is split into `eleven-tts.functions.ts` (callable from the browser) and `eleven-tts.server.ts` (key and ElevenLabs call, server only) |
| Package | Named `app-builder-workspace`, 58 dependencies (44 unused), login and database code, `public/__grok` | Named `lummings-bedtime`, 16 dependencies, no login or database code |
| Security alerts | 1 high-severity (`zod`) | `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities |
| Third-party requests | Google Fonts on every page; a remote script from `grok.com`; share images from `og.grok.me`; messaging to a Grok preview host | None from the browser. Fonts are bundled; the privacy test fails if a third-party host appears in the source. (The server voice fallback calls ElevenLabs; see below) |
| "Add to home screen" | Broken in production: the manifest was only served by the dev server, and the icon was a generic Grok placeholder | Real `manifest.webmanifest` and icons cropped from the locked Lumo portrait; verified in the build output |
| Paid tier | Fake "Heartlight Plus" gating the end-of-story page and the memory gallery | Removed. Everything is free; nothing is gated |
| CI | Ran only Rust (stub crates) and the site-link audit. **The Python tests were never run in CI.** | `make test` runs pytest and cargo; `make web-check` runs typecheck, lint, tests and build. Python suite also passes under Linux (WSL) |
| Python lint | 73 issues | 0 |
| Voice files | 12 recordings; 25 lines missing | Unchanged. Missing lines stay silent by design |
| Phone QA, offline mode | Not done | Not done (needs a real phone) |

## 3. Claims audit

Status: **Fixed** = changed in this pass. **Flagged** = marked "do not publish" but not rewritten. **Open** = still needs an owner decision or a rewrite.

| Claim or problem | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| "Pre-order" buttons, `$149 / $199 / $349` tiers, "ships Q4 2026", "founder's price", warranties | `docs/index.html` | **Fixed**: replaced with "Early access" (no prices, nothing for sale) |
| "They live on a Raspberry Pi", "runs entirely on-device", "no data ever leaves the toy", "buy the device once" | `docs/index.html` | **Fixed**: rewritten to describe the bedtime app truthfully |
| Hardware pre-order page ("PRE-ORDER OPEN", `$129` in the structured data, a different price from `$149`) | `docs/shop.html` | **Fixed**: replaced by a "Not for sale yet" notice |
| Waitlist form that never worked (a JavaScript syntax error) | `docs/index.html` | **Fixed** and syntax-checked; copy now says "early access", not "production" |
| 75 corrupted links, stylesheet and script tags, including all of the Living Lummings app page's scripts and styles | 13 pages under `docs/` | **Fixed**. The link audit now also detects this kind of corruption |
| **Open voice endpoint.** `eleven-tts.server.ts` is a public server function that spends your ElevenLabs credits for any request with an allowed voice id and up to 1,400 characters of text. Anyone who finds it can burn credits. It also falls back to reading a key file at `/workspace/.grok/eleven.key` | `web/src/lib/eleven-tts.server.ts` | **Open**: before launch, allow only known authored lines (or add rate limits), remove the sandbox key-file fallback, and set a spending cap in ElevenLabs |
| Hardware campaign documents (Kickstarter, pre-order, press sheet, parent quickstart) | `docs/` | **Flagged** "archived hardware concept, do not publish" |
| Ready-to-post drafts claiming "runs entirely on-device, no cloud" | `marketing/` (6 files), `docs/demo-video-script.md` | **Flagged** "draft, do not post" |
| Privacy policy describing a toy and a companion app | `docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md` | **Fixed**: rewritten for the bedtime app and waitlist; the old one is archived as `PRIVACY_POLICY_HARDWARE_CONCEPT.md`. Not reviewed by a lawyer |
| Personal email address published in the privacy page of the shop | `docs/shop/privacy.html` | **Open**: confirm which contact address to publish |
| **The `/shop/` storefront ("The Indie Forge")**: sells other products (Ultra Studio, SHInEyVErSE) at $29 to $499 AUD and describes the Lummings as "local-AI characters, no cloud". It loads the Tailwind CDN and Google Fonts | `docs/shop/index.html` and the lead-magnet pages | **Open**: your commerce, so not changed. Decide whether it stays under the Lummings site, and make its Lummings claims match the product |
| External CDNs (Tailwind CDN, Google Fonts, a confetti script) | `docs/app/index.html`, `docs/companion` pages | **Open**: acceptable for a developer preview, not for a children's product. Bundle them before any launch |
| "Heartlight Plus" and other purchase wording in the older Flutter and docs companion apps | `app/`, `docs/companion` | **Open**: remove or retire with those apps |
| Battery life, charging times, app-store availability, Bluetooth pairing | archived hardware documents | **Flagged**; do not use |

**Claims you can make today.** Each is backed by the code or a test.
- The bond between a child and a friend is kept in the browser on the device. No account is needed to hear a story.
- No ads, no analytics, and the app loads nothing from other companies' servers (a test enforces this).
- A parent PIN protects the grown-up page. It stays on the device. *(It is a gentle gate, not strong security: the PIN is stored unhashed.)*
- **The microphone is off by default.** A grown-up can turn on "Talk". If they do, the browser may send speech to its own speech service; the app says so. *(Do not say "the microphone is always off" or "nothing ever leaves the phone".)*
- Most voices are recordings. If a line has no recording, our server asks ElevenLabs to say it in the friend's voice; only the friends' own authored lines are sent, never what a child types or says. *(Do not say "voices are only recordings" or "no text-to-speech".)*
- Five friends with different personalities, and stories that end with a game in the middle.
- Free to try while it is tested. *(Say nothing more about price until it is decided.)*

## 4. Assets you already have

| Asset | Where | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Locked portraits (5) | repo root PNGs, `web/public/crew/*.jpg`, `site/avatars/*.jpg` | Landing page, social posts |
| App icons | `web/public/icons/` (cropped from the Lumo portrait) | Home screen |
| Social card | `web/public/og.jpg` | Link previews (needs `VITE_SITE_URL`) |
| Intro clips | `imagine_videos/` (14), `brand/intros/` | Short clips. Check each for old Sprout voice and wording first |
| Voice recordings | `web/public/voices/` (12) | In-app and clips |
| Five new ElevenLabs voices | owner's ElevenLabs account | Next recordings (see decision 1 in `ROADMAP.md`) |
| Social drafts | `marketing/` | All flagged; rewrite against the claims above |
| Launch strategy | `marketing/SOFTWARE_LAUNCH_STRATEGY.md` | The channel and pilot plan |

**Missing:** a real screen recording of the web app on a phone, a landing page for the web app at its final address, and a contact address you are happy to publish.

## 5. Launch sequence

1. **Done in this pass:** truth on the home page, privacy policy, scaffolding removal, CI, security alert, broken links.
2. **Next (about a week):** decide the hosting address and set `VITE_SITE_URL`; clean the `/shop/` and app-page items in section 3; choose the canonical voices and record the 25 missing lines; phone QA and offline.
3. **Then:** one landing page with one button (the waitlist, now working); recruit 10 to 15 families through permitted channels (ask moderators first); begin the four-week supervised pilot.
4. **Weeks 3 to 6:** three short clips a week from real footage. Disclose any gifted access. Do not condition gifts on praise.
5. **Week 7:** review voluntary return at weeks 2 and 4, safety, support load and running costs. Only then decide on pricing or wider reach. Paid advertising waits for a working offer and a capped test with a stop rule.

## 6. Approvals and clearances

- **Trademark:** clear *Lummings*, *Lumo*, *Luna*, *Sprout*, *Nori*, *Moki* in each market and class before packaging or paid advertising.
- **Child safety and privacy:** have qualified specialists review the parent gate, stored data, the opt-in microphone and any generated media. If you market to families in other countries, check each country's children's privacy rules (for example the Australian Privacy Act, US COPPA, UK Children's Code).
- **Advertising standards:** Australian Consumer Law and platform rules prohibit misleading claims; section 3 exists to prevent that. Endorsements and gifted access must be disclosed.
- **Voices:** keep your ElevenLabs plan and licence terms on file for commercial use of the five designed voices.

## 7. Owner decisions

See `ROADMAP.md`, "Decisions needed". The ones that block advertising: the hosting address, the contact email, what happens to the `/shop/` storefront, and which voices are canonical.
