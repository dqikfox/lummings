## The story

> The Lummings are five small characters from a future where everything has been remembered. They were sent back in time with one mission: help today's children build a better tomorrow.

Each Lumming has a distinct personality. **Lumo** loves science. **Lila** loves stories. **Pip** loves puzzles. **Nori** loves big questions. **Moki** loves jokes.

They live on a Raspberry Pi inside a child-friendly shell. All AI runs locally — no cloud, no subscription, no telemetry, no advertising. The child speaks to the Lumming; the Lumming remembers.

---

## Why now

Three things converged in 2025-2026:

1. **Small LLMs are good enough.** A 1.5B-parameter model on a Pi Zero 2 W runs coherently for a children's companion.
2. **Parents reject cloud AI for children.** COPPA, GDPR-K, and school district AI policies all push toward local. We're aligned with the regulatory wind.
3. **The smart-toy market is wide open.** Furby sold 40 million units in the 1990s. Hasbro relaunched Furby in 2023. The market has been primed for a smarter, privacy-respecting version.

## The technical differentiator

- **Local AI on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.** 1.5 GB RAM footprint for a quantized 1.5B model. The device works offline.
- **Five distinct personalities**, each with their own voice, mission, mood graph, and refusal list.
- **Persistent memory across days, weeks, months.** The Lumming remembers what the child has learned.
- **Open source.** The brain, the personality engine, the device runtime — all MIT-licensed at github.com/dqikfox/lummings.

---

## Privacy stance

- No data collection. No telemetry. No analytics. No advertising.
- The child speaks to the Lumming; the Lumming remembers.
- The child can ask the Lumming to forget at any time.
- Parents can wipe the device's memory with a button.

This isn't a feature. **It's the brand.**

## Quote from the founder

> We built the Lummings because every cloud-connected smart toy we'd ever seen compromised on either privacy or character. The Lummings are the alternative: a character with memory, on a device your child owns, that never sends a byte to anyone.

> — Hitchy, founder
